# Playlist Transfer Application

This is an application I built for myself when I decided to activate a Youtube Premium account and drop Spotify. While I do believe that Spotify has a superior recommendation algorithm, I could no longer ignore the benefits of having a Youtube Premium. Youtube has become a vital education tool for me (as well as entertainment), but it allows me to find information about any topic as opposed to choosing from available options (as you would on a streaming service).

Due to Youtube Music's inferior recommendation algorithm I wanted to find a way to transfer the playlists I had already curated in Spotify over to my Youtube Music account. Once I started learning about APIs, I wanted to see if it was possible to build an application that can `get` my Spotify playlists and `post` them into Youtube. Hence, this project was born...

This project is currently in progress, so I have not yet discovered if it is indeed possible.
